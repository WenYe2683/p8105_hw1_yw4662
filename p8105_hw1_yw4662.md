### Setup

``` r
library(moderndive) # load the moderndive dataset
library(ggplot2) # load plotting
data("early_january_weather") #load the early_january_weather dataset from moderndive data
```

### Short description of the dataset

This dataset contains hourly weather observations for NYC airports over
early January.

- **Time span**: from 2013-01-01 01:00 to 2013-01-15 23:00.

- **Size**: 358 rows $\times$ 15 columns.

- **Variables**: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid,
  wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour.

- **Mean air temperature**: 39.6°F

### Scatterplot: `temp` vs `time_hour`, colored by `humid`

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather,
            aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 1.3) +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature over time, colored by relative humidity",
    x = "Time (hourly)",
    y = "Temperature (°F)",
    color = "Humidity"
  )
```

### Brief description of patterns

Temperatures fluctuate in daily cycles, generally cooler overnight and
warmer during daytime. Points with lower humidity (darker colors) tend
to appear during cooler periods, suggesting a direct relationship
between temperature and relative humidity.

``` r
ggsave(
  filename = "temp_vs_time_hour_by_humid.png"
)
```
